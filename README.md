# Sign Language CNN
This CNN predicts the corresponding letter of an input image of someone's hand doing sign language.

## Notes
This CNN was trained on 28x28 grayscale images, so it may not perform that well on real life images.

The network should be able to perform with an accuracy of 70% with the current hyperparameters.

## Dependencies
The program requires the following libraries:
* Torch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Torchvision
